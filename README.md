# DJ Hibachi
A rhythm game about a depressing hibachi chef without any ingredients. To entertain his customers, he bangs his spatulas on the empty counter instead.

This game was submitted as a part of a game jam, and you can play it here: https://maguromaniac.itch.io/dj-hibachi.

My excuse for the lack of polish is that I was studying for a networking test at the same time.

This game was made using the Unity engine and written in C#.
